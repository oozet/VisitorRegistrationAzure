I have learned about cold starts. Every redeploy causes api calls to take a long time. So for production sites a premium plan would be better.
Learned about workflows and actions. Skip building app because it's not required. Hopefully removed building of api if no changes are made there.
Working on figuring out logging and KQL Kusto Query Language. Still not sure how to show LogInformation in traces.
